***************************************************    


This is a simple buildroot project example.  The 
instructions below describe where to place the files.

I have tried to add some comments in the file to 
describe some of the components.   I am sure the
Instructions will improve after I forgot what I did
and have to figure this out again.

Directory Structure you need to have in Buildroot

  <SDK> 
     |
     - buildroot
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - hello_world   {create here or below -> place the files below )      
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - Config.in
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - hello_world.mk
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - (optional- any files/folders you want)
     |      |      |
     |      |      - <Other standard OpenWRT Packages>     
     |      |      |
     |      |      v 
     |      |   
     |      - <Other buildroot folders>
     |
      - buildroot-external-marvell
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - hello_world     (create this folder here or above)      
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - Config.in
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - hello_world.mk
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - (optional- any files/folders you want)
     |      |      |
     |      |      - <Other Marvell based OpenWRT Packages>     
     |      |      |
     |      |      v 
     |      - <Other external-buildroot-marvell  folders>
     |
     - "output" and other sdk folders
     |  
     v

=> File Info:

    "Config.in" -> used by Buildroot's "make menuconfig" command to 
      place entries in the menu. By default, the hello_world package 
      is not included by default. (equivalent to Kconfig in linux kernel) 

    "Hello_world.mk" -> Tells buildroot
        a) where to find the package source code 
        b) what mechanism to download/fetch 
        c) how/when to build/compile the package
        d) where the resulting executible should be placed in the 
              target System.


Files from Github

     |      - helpers
     |             | 
     |             - k -> A bash script. Should be placed in the buildroot
     |                     <output> directory.  Does a clean removal of 
     |                     any cached components of the "package", such 
     |                     that when you run "make hello_world", the sources
     |                     tar file will be re-downloaded from the source. 
     |             | 
     |             - Trans -> a bash script which can be run from anywhere.
     |                        The script deletes the package in the buildroot
     |                        directory, and then updates the Config.in and 
     |                        hellow_world.mk from Github. Useful when testing
     |                        changes to the .mk file. 
     |             | 


 
=> Comments on my implementation:

    1) Buildroot can download a package via multiple mechanisms.  
       a) I have configured hello_world.mk to get the "hello_world.tgz"
            source code from my web server on Hooch (10.11.65.84:80) 
       b) The "hello_world.mk" also has lines commented out which will
          fetch the "hello_world.tgz" from a local directory on the
          build machine. The locaion I have specified in "hellow_world.mk" 
          is:  
             <sdk>/<buildroot>/package/hello_world/hello_world.tgz 
       c) you can also fetch project source via wget, http, or scp.
       d) WARNING:  buildroot will add "/" for you as part of the 
           target location.  Buildroot will by default strip the first 
           "path directory" in your .tgz file.  My .mk file overrides this
           to not strip any directory path.      

    2) I set up a Github progject that you "clone" to a working directory.  
         From there, you must manually copy project files to the proper 
         location in buildroot.  Additionally you must modify buildroot's 
         make and configure files to have the hello_world package build as 
         part of calliing make.   
         
    3) <REVISION> of the package is defined in hello_world.mk


=> Get the files
   1)  get the hello_world package from Github, place the source in the top 
       level directory "/scratch"
   
   mkdir -p /scratch
   cd /scratch
   git clone https://github.com/fmcoastal/buildroot_hello_world.git  hello_world

   2) the files and file structure should look like what is shown above. 

   3) build the source tar file required by build root for package source files. 
       the script "x" will put the contentes of the hello_world directory into 
       a .tgz file in a format which buildroot will later explode into the 
       directory  <sdk>/<output>/build/hello_world-1.0.0  when Make is run.
   
       cd /scratch/hello_world
       ./x
   3.1) put the resulting .tgz file in the location specified in the 
       "package/hello_world.mk" location.  Recall from above that I am using 
       a http server for buildroot to fetch from.  (you can use a local directory)

       scp /scratch/hello_world-1.0.0.tgz   root@10.11.65.84:/var/www/html/.
    

=> Configure buildroot  - manual Placement
    
    4) Determine which package location you want to install the
         hello_world package in.  For me, I will use the
         <SDK>/buildroot-external-marvell/package location.  
        (You could also place it in <SDK>/buildroot/package location)

    5) cd buildroot or buildroot-external

    cd  /sdk/<SDK>/buildroot-external-marvell/package

    6) Make a directory hello_world

    mkdir -p hello_world

    7) copy Config.in and hello_world.mk from your git download
       to your

    cd hello_world
    cp /scratch/hello_world/package/Config.in .
    cp /scratch/hello_world/package/hello_world.mk .
 
    8) Modify <sdk>/buildroot-external-marvell/Config.in to have it look in
       the packages/hello_world directory for a Config.in file

       add the following to the last line in the "<sdk>/buildroot-external
       -marvell/Config.in" file

       source "$BR2_EXTERNAL_MARVELL_SDK_PATH/package/hello_world/Config.in"
    

    9) (REFERENCE) the <sdk>/buildroot-external-marvell/external.mk is written to 
       walk through each directory in the Package file and look for a .mk file when 
       the "make" is executed in the <output> directory.
 
       The hello_world.mk file tells build root about revision info, where to 
       find source code, how to unpack source code. In addition, the are multiple
       other defines which can be implemented to support the install process. Look 
       specifically at 
       
        https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#writing-rules-mk
        and 
        https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#hooks


     10) if everything is configured correctly, you should be able to execute 
        "make hello_world" in your <output> dirctory.  Buildroot will:
            create the folling directory:  "<output>/build/hello_world-1.0.0"  
         the folder will have:
               I.  your source code in it. 
              II.  the compiled output.  (hello)
             III.  and if you rebuild your rootfs, a copy of the "hello" executible
                   will be in the /bin directory. 
       
         transfer the executable to your target, and run hello!
