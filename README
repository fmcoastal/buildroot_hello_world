***************************************************    


This is a simple buildroot project example.  The 
instructions below describe where to place the files.

I have tried to add some comments in the file to 
describe some of the components.   I am sure the
Instructions will improve after I forgot what I did
and have to figure this out again.

Directory Structure you need to have in Buildroot

  <SDK> 
     |
     - buildroot
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - hello_world   {create here or below -> place the files below )      
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - Config.in
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - hello_world.mk
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - (optional- any files/folders you want)
     |      |      |
     |      |      - <Other standard OpenWRT Packages>     
     |      |      |
     |      |      v 
     |      |   
     |      - <Other buildroot folders>
     |
      - buildroot-external-marvell
     |      |
     |      - package
     |      |      |
     |      |      - hello_world     (create this folder here or above)      
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - Config.in
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - hello_world.mk
     |      |      |      |
     |      |      |      - (optional- any files/folders you want)
     |      |      |
     |      |      - <Other Marvell based OpenWRT Packages>     
     |      |      |
     |      |      v 
     |      - <Other external-buildroot-marvell  folders>
     |
     - "output" and other sdk folders
     |  
     v

=> File Info:

    "Config.in" -> used by Buildroot's "make menuconfig" command to 
      place entries in the menu. By default, the hello_world package 
      is not included by default. (equivalent to Kconfig in linux kernel) 

    "Hello_world.mk" -> Tells buildroot
        a) where to find the package source code 
        b) what mechanism to download/fetch 
        c) how/when to build/compile the package
        d) where the resulting executible should be placed in the 
              target System.


Files from Github

     - hello_world
     |      |
     |      - Config.in
     |      |
     |      - hello_world.mk  
     |      |  
     |      - hello_world-<REVISION>.tgz
     |      |  
     |      - README  (This file)
     |      |  
     |      - src
     |             | 
     |             - hello_world.c
     |             | 
     |             - Makefile
     |             | 
     |             - x     (bash file to create hello_world-<REVISION>.tgz

 
=> Comments on my implementation:

    1) Buildroot can download a package via multiple mechanisms.
       a) I have configured the hello_world.mk file to look for 
          hello_world.tgz on my local machine at  
             <sdk>/<buildroot>/package/hello_world/hello_world.tgz 
       b) you can also fetch project source via wget, http, or scp. 

    2) I set up a Github progject that you can "clone" direclty to 
         the project directory.  You can also "clone" the code to 
         any other location and copy the files to the appropriate
         location in the buildroot <SDK> structure.   
       a) taking into account your git/svn structure, you may want 
         to modify hello_world.mk to point to the location of your 
         source/download.   
    3) <REVISION> of the package is defined in hello_world.mk


=> Install Instructions - manual Placement
    
    1) Determine which package location you want to install the
         hello_world package in.  For me, I will use the
         buildroot-external-marvell/package location.

    2) cd buildroot or buildroot-external

    cd  /sdk/<SDK>/buildroot-external-marvell/package



=> Install Instructions -  github clone to "project" directory

------------------------------------------     
link the file on your http server

  ln hello_world-1.0.0.tgz /var/www/html/hello_world-1.0.0.tgz


test you can get the file
   wget root@10.11.65.84:80/hello_world-1.0.0.tgz
